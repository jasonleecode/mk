# RISC-V does not natively support subword atomics, such as __atomic_load_1 or
# __atomic_load_2. The RISC-V gcc developers have decided to emulate these via
# libatomic, which is suboptimal as it forces you to link against libatomic.
# However, there are plans to solve this properly in the future, without
# libatomic, analogous to how gcc does it on other architectures:
# https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/issues/12#issuecomment-542735796
#
# Until then, we need an interim solution for L4Re, because the official
# workaround, which is that gcc on RISC-V just always automatically links
# against libatomic, does not work for L4Re because we call the linker directly,
# not through gcc.

# libgcc_eh must be before libgcc in link order as it might reference hidden
# symbols defined in libgcc (for example outline atomics). The order is
# important for shared objects, as these are linked without library grouping,
# i.e. libraries are searched only once in the order they are specified.
